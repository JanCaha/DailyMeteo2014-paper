The folder contains 3 datasets (stations.txt, cr_sims.txt, meuse_sims.txt).

The calculations of meuse kriging is in file Meuse_kriging.R, following that is the the file Meuse_fuzzy_surface_simulations.R where estimates of the fuzzy surface are calculated and simulations or random krigings performed. 

The calculations of PM10 in Czech republic kriging is in the file CR_kriging.R, following that is the file CR_fuzzy_surface_simulations.R where estimates of the fuzzy surface are calculated and simulations or random krigings performed. 

The last is the file simulation_eval.R that presents graphs of results.

The file _functionDefitions.R is only used for storing functions that are used for a fuzzy surface estimation and simulations calculation.
